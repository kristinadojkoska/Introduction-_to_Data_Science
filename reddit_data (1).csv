Microsoft should be sued for how poorly their store works.,"Just activated a Sea of Thieves key in the store. Downloaded it once, played for a few days, then yesterday it crashed with an error for corrupt files. Tried to reinstall.. error.. okay so uninstall.. doesn't actually uninstall.. tried to delete the install.. no perms.. finally found a work around to delete the game but the store stays stuck on downloading without actually increasing the amount downloaded. To top it all off, I can't get a refund because the key was bought through another site. The game worked fine at first, as far as I'm concerned Microsoft owes me money.

Today I just bought it on steam cause fuck that mess I'm never using the store again and Microsoft should have their asses handed to them in court over this garbage software. Literally stole money from me üò°",1692914952.0

Is MS fiddling with Edge?,"Hello everyone,a few days ago I got an popup-notification on my dekstop that asked me to change my search engine to Bing. Thought it was suspicious and checked in the task manager, what program caused the popup. It was an .exe called ""**BGAUpsell**"" which is located under **C:\\Windows\\Temp\\MUBSTemp**. Is this legit or malware? Virustotal says it's okay. But what raises my suspicion is, that it was installed the exact same time (by minute) I downloaded a word file (which I also checked with Defender and Virustotal). Might be coincidence, since I started the PC only for working on that word file, so all that happened shortly after booting up.

Another odd thing that happened: One day later there appeared a new shortcut on my dekstop called ""Business - Edge"". I noticed it today, but properties say it was created that day (day before yesterday, August 21st). The shortcut opens the normal Edge-exe (""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe"") but with the paramters ""--profile-directory=""Default"""".

So my question: Is this some sort of malware or is Microsoft fiddling around? I almost never use Edge. Did anybody else noticed this on their devices?",1692825127.0

Microsoft email spam detection is pathetic,"I primarily use Gmail as my main email provider, but I've kept my childhood Hotmail account specifically for Microsoft-related matters such as Windows, Edge, Xbox, my personal Azure account, and Microsoft certifications.

Hotmail has consistently been troublesome, with regular spam infiltrating my inbox on a weekly basis. However, the past week has taken things to a whole new level of annoyance. I've been bombarded with a minimum of five scam emails every day. I haven't noticed any of my accounts being compromised, nor have I knowingly signed up for anything shady. Regardless of whether my email was leaked or if a service I'm using was hacked, Hotmail should ideally have the capability to sift through and filter out this kind of junk. Practically every major email provider, such as Gmail, Apple Mail, and ProtonMail, excels at spam blocking. In stark contrast, Microsoft's Hotmail/Outlook service appears to be lagging behind in this regard. It's a complete POS.

Strangely, despite Microsoft's reputation as one of the world's foremost experts in cybersecurity, their email services are frustratingly subpar. And they actually have the balls to still offer a premium paid option.

Interesting relationship between Windows systems,"I have a theory about Windows 12. Every second Windows is good or bad e. g. Me, XP, Vista....

Bing chat app on android is consuming way too much CPU,"When I open bing chat on my phone (Samsung A52 5G) it works fine, but scrolling and opening menus is a bit laggy but the bigger issue is that it heats up my phone a lot, to the point of burning my hands and thermal throttling (Samsung Good Guardians shows when device thermal throttles)

Using GPUWatch (A built in feature on samsung phones) I see that while bing chat is open but idle, the CPU usage is 60%, regularly spiking up to 100%,
When I actually use the app by opening chat menu, settings or scrolling, the CPU stays at 100% almost constantly.

The issues are much worse on my tablet though, (Tab S7 FE)
The app is insanely slow and barely functions, when I open it, sometimes the nav bar glitches out and keeps popping up, then dissapearing, likely from there being not enough resources left for android to function properly. And the GPUWatch shows the CPU is constantly at 100%

Unable to play sound from inport speakers,"Hey  all.

I'm going to apologize in advance for my knowing so little of computers. I use my PC for the absolute surface level of functionality mostly for school.

The only thing I have not tried doing is doing a complete factory reset which I am trying to avoid if possible. 

My device manager says that the sound, video, and game controllers are functioning properly, so I don't think it can be a hardware issue, especially since my speakers do work occasionally.

I have seen some say that it is from installing windows, but the folder was created on June 8th 2023 and i got my computer back in August of 2021...?  


Also, when I try to open the folder it says:

""You do not have sufficient permission to access this folder.""

""Click on Continue to gain permanent access to this folder."" ('Windows Defender shield' ""Continue"")

(In my language)

Also worth mentioning that the folder holds 0 bytes.

So I'm wondering... what is this actually for? Will something bad happen to my current account if I press ""Continue""? Can I just press ""Continue"" and delete it?",1692288873.0
Need to show that a file or folder is completed (for work purposes),"Is there a way in Explorer to have a checkmark that has a PERMANENTLY check to show that I completed this file or folder? I know that you can have a check next to the filename but need to have it always checked if I checked to show that I completed the task with that file. Or even having a line through the file name to show that I am finished with the file.  
Also I am using Windows 11.  
I hope this makes sense. Thank you and God bless.

Defender vs Intune Policy Confusion,"Hi All,

Just started a new role as a Security Engineer and am taking on Defender for Endpoint which I haven't got a lot of experience with.

Currently swotting up asap, but struggling to work out where the delineation is between what is enforced on Endpoints by Defender, and what is enforced by Intune.

For instance,  according to Defender if I look at a Device, it shows as ""Managed by"" Intune. When I go back into Intune and look at, for example, ""Endpoint Security"" > ""Manage"" > ""Antivirus"" I noticed a few AV Policies.

If I choose one that has Yes in the Assigned column and ""mdm,microsoftSense"" in the Target column, I am I to be making an assumption that it is targeting all devices? If I open the Profile, it doesn't appear to target anything. E.g. some group that is empty, and no counts listed in ""Device and user check-in status"".

If I look at the device itself and choose ""Device Configuration"" I see a list of Policies that don't necessarily reflect what I see in the  ""Endpoint Security"" > ""Manage"" section.

Does this mean even though the devices appear to have Defender for Endpoint installed, we aren't using any of the customised policies?

I've had a look at Baselines and these don't seem to be assigned either.

Can anyone advise, or point me on where best to get some clarification?

Many thanks in advance,

My question is my answers were submitted and the school has already the information or do I have to take the quiz again?

Creating a M365 Tenant/Admin centre.,"Hi there,

 I was just wandering what the best way would be to create a M365 tenant?

Constantly Receiving Microsoft One-Time Use Codes via Email - Security Concerns?,"Hey all!

I've been facing a puzzling issue lately and I thought this community might be able to shed some light on it. For the past few weeks, I've been receiving Microsoft one-time use codes in my email inbox at least three times a day. It's becoming quite frustrating and concerning.

Every single day, without fail, I get these codes sent to my email as if someone is attempting to access my Microsoft account. I've double-checked and confirmed that I'm not initiating these requests myself. I've also taken all possible security measures - enabled two-factor authentication, changed my password, and reviewed my account activity. Nothing suspicious seems to be happening on my end.

However, the regularity and consistency of these code requests have me worried. Is this a common occurrence for anyone else? Could it be a glitch in the system or something more sinister? I've never experienced this with any other service, and it's really starting to make me anxious about the security of my account and personal information.

Has anyone here encountered a similar situation? If so, how did you address it? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. I'm hoping to get to the bottom of this and ensure the safety of my account.

Thanks in advance for your help!",1691960190.0

‚ÄúUnusual sign-in activity‚Äù,"So basically, today, somewhat around 4am I received a mail saying that someone tried to log into my Microsoft account. It did look very like a scam mail, so I did not click the link, but I checked the Microsoft‚Äôs website, and the mail address was very much the official address that they supposedly send these mails from.

I still didn‚Äôt click on the link, just installed the Microsoft 365 Mobile app (since I don‚Äôt have an access to PC now) and tried to log into that account. And in fact once I logged in they sent me an email with a code.

The mail address is exactly the same as the one that sent me the mail about unusual sign-in. They just don‚Äôt have the same ‚Äúprofile pictures‚Äù but nonetheless I still didn‚Äôt click the first link.

They required me to confirm the code in the app. Next step they asked me to change my password, which I did.

microsoft arc touch mouse - faithful companion died,"not sure if any of you have similar experiences

i have an OG [microsoft arc touch mouse](https://imgur.com/9lqINHA) bought back in 2011. i loved that thing to bits. it's the generation that still uses a usb receiver, not the bluetooth version, and before microsoft decided to slap the ""surface"" logo on all their pc peripherals.

anyhow, somewhere along the way it got misplaced (probably around 2019) and i didn't use it then, recently it somehow resurfaced. happily i popped a couple of fresh batteries into it and clicked it on - the blue laser shone for a couple of minutes and then it went dead.

before it died, i had the usb receiver plugged in and it actually worked for a while - the curser moved, right and left click, even the haptic scroll worked. then it blacked out and died. changing batteries didn't help.

i suspect that it could be some kind of contact issue but i'm not exactly confident. anyone else has a similar issue? i watched a teardown video on youtube and my gosh this thing is over-engineered, i don't think i would be able to put it back together if i had to disassemble to change out the bad part. hopefully the fix is easy and it doesn't turn into e-waste. thanks!

Word forgetting words I added to the dictionary,"So I'm a fantasy writer, and a lot of the words I use are not only made up language words, but often have accents and such. So what I usually do so I can type faster is not just add the word to the dictionary when I get the spellchecker squiggle, but add an autocorrect option that will automatically correct it to that word. So say I have a name like ""K√≠r"", I won't only add it to the dictionary to get spellchecker off my back, but add it to autocorrect so I can just type ""Kir"" and it autocorrects to ""K√≠r"" for me without me having to click over to the insert symbol drop-down. But now I'm getting the spellchecker squiggle again on words I've already added to the dictionary and to autocorrect. Luckily they still do autocorrect, but Word doesn't seem to ""remember"" I added them to the dictionary so spellchecker wouldn't flag and I would have pages littered with red squiggles. I could probably just turn spellchecker off, but I do remember this same thing happened to my Word program on my old dinosaur of a computer from thr '00s when monitors were still big bulky boxes, and I just wondered if this is a result of Word either needing an update or the software just being worn down from heavy use? I think when I tried to have someone look at it last time it was something to do with wearing out the hard drive, but this is on a computer I bought at the beginning of this year. So I was just curious if this was something that would bug the system. I do use Word a lot on the computer, (writer) so I was just curious.",1691592736.0

How to get a job at Microsoft?,"Hey Guys,

In Search of a 2011 Mac Word Wizard - Serious Help Required,"Like the title says I am in need of some serious help.

I have a older MacBook 2012 edition with a 2011 version of Microsoft word on it.

The other day I was finishing a document I was writing and all of a sudden all of my 40 page document had turned into asterisks (*) symbols.

I had autosave on however I now know this only saves the changes I‚Äôve made within word and does not create a separate backup file.

Also I have checked the time capsule feature on mac and the date I last did a backup was over 2 years ago which is no help.

I have done some homework and have tried the following things‚Ä¶

- tried to copy and paste the whole document into a new blank document

- checked to see if the hidden box was checked for the font

- tried changing the font/changing the color

- tried to restart word/computer

- tried download the version pack 1 update as I read this should fix the asterisks problem once installed but no luck

- tried downloading a trial version of the newest word for mac to try and open my saved asterisk word file in there but that didnt work either

I am hoping someone knows how to fix this as its super important.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

MICROSOFT CAMERA NOT WORKING AFTER UPDATE CRASH (Lenovo),"***CONTEXT***: Around 2 or 3 months ago with my laptop crashed due to the CPU overheating, then when I tried to turn it back on it needed to update. I don't remember exactly but I had left the laptop for a couple of hours and no progress took place. The update screen specifically stated DONT TURN OFF THE COMPUTER WHILE UPDATING. And I did just that. The result was that any applications that I had been using right before the crash were 'corrupted' (idk if that's the right word) and just wouldn't open, such as Chrome, Spotify, and Discord. The way I fixed that is by re-installing the apps through Microsoft Edge (which I never use) and that worked. However, I have not found a fix for my camera specifically.

 

I have tried uninstalling it through Command Line and re-installing on the Microsoft store and that didn't work. When I open the app, it continually switches between the camera interface (in which the camera shows nothing but grey), and an error message screen stating:

""CLOSE OTHER APPS It looks like another app is using the camera already. If you need it, here's the error code:  0xA00F4243""

I have tried almost everything and ensured there's no other apps using the camera, how do I fix this??",1691184263.0

Onedrive really?,"Microsoft, what the actual fuck.  

You are starting to act more and more like Apple, in the worst of ways.

So my wife's SSD was full. I had her go through and uninstall games she isn't playing, and remove other things and then we noticed that OneDrive was taking up 80 GB's of space...Now I'm thinking I can just delete that data from the onedrive section, did this on her desktop...Well I was wrong deleted all her shortcuts on the desktop.  Then I think maybe I should dig into this more. Again thinking that cleaning my wife's computer off would be a simple task. It isn't at some point a switch got flipped and it started duplicating the desktop, Documents folder, and Downloads... My wife is not so naive as to select those, and I have personally seen onedrive default to duplicating those three folder locations which to me seems stupid but for a common user probably makes sense. Well I read a post saying that to delete the files from OneDrive you need to unlink the account from the computer...I do this and it deletes all the Documents, Desktop, and Downloads folders.  Then I do more searching and find out that if a certain setting is on it will delete everything...No pop up windows, no other warnings just delete all my wife's music she wrote, a bunch of important invoices for her business.  All because Microsoft is trying to peddle OneDrive, because instead of making this a simple or easy process it constantly bombards me with. YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF SPACE, QUICKLY UPGRADE. Thanks a Fucking lot. I have to deal with my fucking Ipad deleteing my apps, and now Windows is just Duplicating shit and then deleting it, because those are the default settings.

Microsoft is now pushing Edge from Outlook too," 

Now Outlook is pushing Edge too. When clicking on a URL in Outlook it default opens in Edge. In the advanced settings of Outlook you can change it back to your default browser. I am using Firefox as default and I want to stay using Firefox so this is very irritating.

Microsoft is constantly pushing their own apps to be the default. Very annoying. When I set my default browser that means I want to use a default browser for everything right? That's why its called a DEFAULT browser. Now I have to dig in the Advanced features of Outlook to tell Outlook it should use my DEFAULT browser when opening a URL. 

They also changed my screen capture tool to the Microsoft snipping tool. I already had a better tool!  

Somewhere the advanced settings of Windows you can revert to your own choice but this  tying to their own products starts to get very annoying.

Single Use Codes,"I'm wondering if anyone can help or advise what I should do regarding about 15+ single use codes being generated for my email account every day.

This has been a problem for a while with one or two for a week or so, then it dies down, but recently it's been getting significantly more rampant with excessive codes being generated with about 3 or so an hour for a few hours, especially overnight.

I have set up an alias, so this email the codes are being generated for isn't even authorised to be used to sign into my account anymore, which I figured would stop it, but it hasn't. I've also set up 2FA & changed my password to a unique one, so I know my account is completely secure.

These codes are not associated with any attempted sign in activity on my security dashboard, the only thing I can think is causing it is the failed automatic syncs on my account, which I suspect are the culprits and are not associated with me.

Everything online says creating an alias would solve this but it hasn't. Is there anything else I can do to stop this?

I have no concerns my email security has been compromised but these codes are so annoying I just want to figure out how to get them to stop. I also can't figure out how they're generating these codes as when I select forgotten password for the account there is no option to generate a single use code. 

Any insight will be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: SOLVED

I have figured out the problem. It was an old email address I used when I was a child/teen that had been breached (no surprises there based on the shit I used to sign up to üòÇ), my current email was set up to recieve the verification codes for logging in to that email so that's where they were coming from. All these sign in attempts and codes were directly correlated with sign in attempts on that email, not my current email.

Im aware this isnt the case on laptops but i seen somewhere that you could use outlook app with the basic licenses only on screens 10"" or below. Is this the same for the other apps?

PC and Xbox Library,"So I'd originally given up on trying to get all my Xbox games to my Microsoft Library but there is no way I'm spending 30-60$ on something I already own.

I've recently switched to PC gaming from Xbox. I had a extensive Library. Trying to install anything I had on xbox is impossible besides a few games like the ones on xbox play anywhere.

Is there a way to link xbox Library to my PC library to play games I've bought digitally? Or am I stuck with the play anywhere titles/forced to rebuy any games I'd want on pc?

"IDK if this is the right place to post, but I can't think of anywhere else: My Microsoft Outlook email program is saying ""Microsoft apps & services wants to access your Google Account"" How do I solve this? Especially when, if I don't allow access, I'm unable to use Outlook?"," I got this popup recently, when I open Outlook. When I close it, it immediately reopens back up. I have to close it about five times before it goes away for good (until I close and re-open Outlook of course). If instead of closing it, I input my password, then it asks me to either allow or deny access for Microsoft to access my Google Account.

* If I deny access, it tells me ""you have denied access. Please accept access"" and re-opens the original popup.
* If I deny access and close the popup, my email no longer functions, I can not receive or send anything in Outlook anymore.
* I do not want Microsoft accessing and having full control over my Google Account, or vice-versa.
* And finally... I do not have a Google Account. The email I am using in Outlook is not a Gmail, or any other form of Google-related email.

Please help me. How do I get this to go away. I don't want to accept this. I don't want to allow Outlook to access anything more than what it can already access.

Connection to Micosoft Exchange Online performance using different Microsoft tools,"At work, we tested the connection to Exchange in different ways. While it seems to work fine on our local machines, it has some performance problems when the app is deployed. For instance we used three different tools:
1. C# Web API
2. PowerShell Azure Function
3. C# Azure Function
4. Runbook

For instance we used the following documentation for solution 1 and 3
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exo-powershell-c-sharp?view=exchange-ps). Unfortunately, it takes quite a while to retrieve few data, like 30s to get 14 mails from EXO. In all cases, when our apps are published and hosted on the App Service, of those 30s I mentioned before, 25s are needed to connect to exchange, to execute the command ""Connect-ExchangeOnline"". In cases 1 to 3, we're using a certificate to connect to exchange, as indicated by the documentation, with only one change, since we're using the certificate thumbprint. In case n4, we're using a PowerShell command available in Azure automation account. In all cases it takes an awful amount of time to execute the connection command. How can we improve the performance of the exchange connection in our code?

Are these emails legit??,"Every few days for the last month I've been receiving emails in my junk folder for ""Microsoft account unusual signin activity"" (written exactly like that for the subject line).

Attachments aren't showing up for certain recipients - help!,"We use Office 365 for only a handful of employees. All accounts are licensed.

Then I focused on AZ 104 exclusively and passed it on the 27th July. I already had Linux+ and VCP-DCV certifications and both translated in CLI experience and Virtual Infrastructure so those two helped a lot. I studied using Microsoft Learn , John Savill and then just did practice exams until I was passing 9/10 times. Then went for it.  


It is DOABLE for sure. It needs discipline and free time. If you are at a point of your life where you have free time and small amount of family responsabilities i suggest go for it.

Microsoft's ads on user's machines contradict their longstanding design philosophy of not interrupting users,"Microsoft Out1ook contains a feature called ""Reminders"".  The name ""Reminders"" is obviously vague and confusing - even so, there are some who use the feature in the hope that Out1ook will actually remind them of events that they deem important.  


Having purchased and installed Out1ook, the user starts the program and than undertakes the task of defining an event they wish to be reminded of.  While not particularly onerous, defining a reminder is a task a user would only perform if the event they wish to be reminded of was of some importance.  

The importance of reminders has not been lost on Microsoft.  They've tasked their best and brightest engineers with a method for really doing reminders right.  The solution they've come with deserves a _major_ award. You see, Microsoft has carefully developed a method for both reminding and not reminding a user at the same time.  Yes you read that correctly.  Here is how it works:  The user has expressed an explicit desire to be reminded of an event - Out1ook honors that request by displaying a popup window on the user's screen.  However - Microsoft, ever sensitive to the need of their users to not be interrupted, cleverly displays the reminder behind other windows where the user is physically unable to observe it.  

This design is a glorious achievement in the field of designing software that genuinely annoys and sabotages users.  For more than a decade, thousands of users have pleaded with Microsoft to change this behavior:

Several enterprising users have gone so far as to [write their own software](https://superuser.com/questions/251963/how-to-make-outlook-calendar-reminders-stay-on-top-in-windows-7) to forcibly defeat Microsoft's handiwork.

The [official statement from Microsoft](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/sharepoint/en-US/7b84ed1b-a2d2-4bea-ad46-68265cd91ca8/how-to-make-the-outlook-2007-reminder-popup-appear-in-the-foreground):

> ""After consulting and performing further investigation, we confirm that it was the intended design of Out1ook 2007 that the Out1ook reminders do not interrupt an application which has focus. Instead, reminders will only flash in the taskbar and produce the reminder sound.

> For many the taskbar changes in Windows 7 for the reminders are not enough to grab the user's attention to the new reminder, especially if sound is not enabled on the user's computer. Often appointments are missed due to the overlooked reminder.

> Microsoft has noticed this issue and the similar cases are already recorded in the database. Please rest assured that I will forward this request of making the Out1ook reminder appear in the foreground to the appropriate development and usability experts for the purpose of improving user experience in the future. We strive to capture any and all product feedback so as to ensure that we are continuously developing Microsoft products to meet and satisfy the needs of as many customers as possible.""

This behavior exists in Out1ook to this day.  Microsoft has taken the step of allowing users to disable it however it remains the default behavior.

Contrast the behavior of Out1ook to the behavior of Microsoft Windows.  Microsoft boasts of Windows security and configurablity.  There are numerous options in Windows that supposedly allow the user to lock down their system both to protect their privacy and to prevent distraction.  

Given Microsoft's determination to not interrupt the user that they so stringently embrace in their Out1ook design, one would think that Windows users would be immune from bothersome distractions from the operating system itself.  But such is not the case.  Under the pretense of ""Suggestions"" and ""Notifications"", Microsoft routinely bypasses the users explicit instruction to not distract them and prominently displays advertisements directly on the desktop.  

For example the advertisement ""Get rewards, give back.  Join Microsoft Rewards to earn points to make a donation to your favorite cause."" appeared on my screen while I was deeply involved in resolving a code issue for a client.  Thanks to Microsoft's cleverness, I also missed my reminder to submit my hours for the week and was thus inspired to write this post.

This is the second post I've written complaining about Microsoft adware on my machine.  If time permits I'm going to write a post for every ad I see.  And why shouldn't I?  Will I get banned?  How long do you think it will take the moderators to ban me if I post an add for my business on this sub every time Microsoft displays a ""Suggestion"" for their rewards program on my desktop?  

Would that be fair?  If Microsoft can advertise their business using software I've paid for, should I not have the same right to advertise my business using software they have paid for?  

Microsoft fanboys, rather than your usual cowardly down vote why don't you put your big boy pants on and answer my questions.  And BTW I'm not another random Microsoft hater.  I'm a Microsoft developer.  I earn my living using Microsoft products - and I love the products I use.

Migration Google to O365,"Hello, 

I'm helping an organization migrate from Google to O365 and I have a quick question.

So I first had a Google account set up with this company domain, and following I had a Microsoft account set up (same email - [name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com)). 

When I first logged into Microsoft Outlook account it forced a sycn with Google. 

Following, I'm receiving emails in both my gmail and Microsoft outlook inbox. 

In this scenario could I just delete my Google Workspace user and continue to use my Microsoft Outlook account moving forward?

I have a hunch the answer is no as, I still need to go through a standard migration because my email still lives in Gmail and the sync is just redirecting to Outlook. Right?

To add a wrinkle, some users have the same set up but are only receiving emails in Gmail, not Outlook... maybe the circumvented the Microsoft sync somehow?

Any info much appreciated!

I saw somewhere that you can remove your primary email as a login alias so when anyone tried to log in with your email address it says 'not found' or whatever. So I did that, and created a new alias. I tested it out to see what would happen if I tried to use the old address (the one many people are trying to login with) and it says 'account not found'. So I thought 'great, sorted' ...nope. 

I've had a few more since.

I'M SO FRUSTRATED,"Over the past few weeks, my bluetooth headset has just stopped working with my Surface Laptop. They're new headphones from Sennheiser and they worked for a few months with no issue before just randomly shitting the bed (but they still work with other devices, which tells me it's an issue with my computer). The headphones will connect, but not show up as a device for input or output, everything plays through my computer speakers. Wired headphones do not display the same issue, it seems to be a uniquely bluetooth problem (unique to my headphones, other bluetooth devices work fine).

The first time I reached out, I spoke with someone at Microsoft who was great. They helped troubleshoot with me over the phone and I was up and running within about an hour. It appeared to be a driver that needed updating. 

Cue to two weeks later, the same problem occurs. What the heck? I re-downloaded the driver, did all the normal as-you-would-expect troubleshooting of restarting my computer, uninstalling and reinstalling the device, airplane mode, turning off bluetooth and turning it back on, etc. No success. I go online to begin another customer service ticket and realize YOU CANNOT TALK TO SOMEONE ON THE PHONE UNLESS YOU PAY A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION? What? I paid over $1k for this computer and now Microsoft wants me to pay more to talk to someone on the phone? That's absurd. Really got me going, it's SO INEQUITABLE I can't stand it. 

Okay, so I express my discontent but continue in a chat feature to try to get the issue resolved, nothing is working. They want to send me a refurbished computer as a replacement, because I ordered this one last September and I'm now out of the 60-day period of being able to receive a new computer. AITA for not wanting a refurbished computer? It sounds like Microsoft doesn't want to take a loss on a shoddy device, but that sounds like a them issue. Why should I be subject to a used device when it's their product that doesn't work? 

Additionally, this is a device I use for work. I need it everyday. Their solution is to have me package and send it in and then they'll send me a 'new' (refurbished) device within 3-5 business days. When I explained that won't work because of my needing it for work, they said they could try to expedite the process of creating a label within 24 hours and then expediting the shipping to 2-3 business days.   

I'm beyond frustrated. I still haven't received a phone call. All of this exchange has been via chat/email over the past 3 days and I feel nowhere near a resolution. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Any advice on how to proceed? ",1690554598.0

New Outlook,"the new outlook version is so bad. 

I tried new version, and to be honest, I was pretty disappointed. 

Pros: Similar to the previous version, just updated

cons: Laggy, confusing, too many options, many more. 

I could not wait to switch back to the older version. At first, I thought I was doomed, because there was no option to switch back, fortunately, it did it by itself and I am glad, I have the option to toggle between the new or the old. I choose the old. Simple, Easy, and understandable.

Outlook webmail message display - want new messages on bottom and to keep focus there,"I have already set the sort order to ""Oldest on top"".  What I would like is for the default focus to be on the most recently received email, and have that stay on the bottom.  

What is happening now is every time I open webmail, even though I have ""oldest on top"" as my sort choice Outlook still makes me scroll all of the way down to the bottom of the message list every time, which, as my inbox grows, becomes a more tedious task by the day.  For my job I receive up to a hundred emails a day so I'm spending as much time scrolling all the way to the bottom of the list multiple times per day as I am actually reading the emails.

How can I force outlook to open with the focus on the bottom of the list?

How to set permissions to a certain effect,"Hi Everyone,


I am currently working on a project for my course,, and I am very stuck on a particular task involving share permissions and NTFS permissions.

In short, I have done the following: (keep in mind this is a windows 11 machine in a work group configuration)

1. Created 2 users, John and Jane
2. Created a share called DATA at root of C:
3. Share permissions are set to Everyone at Full Control
4. I need to set the NTFS permissions according to the following need:

We are supposed to make it so that both John and Jane can create and manage their own data in the share, but NOT each others data.

For example, John should be able to create a file and manage it. BUT, he can not edit Jane's data that she has created. 

It should be noted that we are instructed NOT to create subfolders in the DATA share.


I am drawing a blank on how to accomplish this without creating subfolders. 

Does anyone have any ideas? Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.",1690392165.0

[Need advice] - What is the process flow when applying for non-technical roles at Microsoft and how long does each step take?,"Hello! I would love to hear your thoughts about my situation. 

About a month ago, I applied for a non-technical role (program manager) at Microsoft as an outsider with no referrals. I just applied through their career site on my own. I am based in Asia Pacific, but the role is based on-site at their HQ in WA state, USA. 

A week or so ago, I received an email from an internal recruiter from Microsoft telling me that they would like to advance me into the process. She then asked me 4 ‚Äúscreening questions‚Äù which I had to answer by replying to the email. I already did and I am looking to hear back from her. One of the questions stated ‚Äúare you willing to relocate to the US to work at the headquarters?‚Äù and I answered yes, coupled with a few words solidifying my interest. 

It‚Äôs been more than a week and I still haven‚Äôt received a response back if I made it to the next round or not. I would love to know the result no matter what it is.

Do you think I am no longer in the contention? What is the whole recruitment process like? How long does it normally take for recruiters to proceed along the whole process? Should I still wait for a couple more weeks? Is it wise to email her again to ask for an update? 

I really want to get this position because working at Microsoft while doing something I am truly passionate about (and experienced in) is one of my dreams so my heart is still hoping for the best, but I don‚Äôt want to get my hopes up too much because it will definitely hurt if I fail.

Surface Laptop Using in Vietnam,"Just wanted advice. I took my work laptop which is a Surface Pro to Vietnam and the battery died on me and I was never able to use it again.

Surface Book 2 issues fixed,"Hey,

I have a surface book 2. I love this surface. Only there are some issues with this laptop. I know there is a majority of people out there still having these issues and I want to help them and the future people having these issues

I will give a fix for all the issues I had.

**1.** **When gaming the battery runs out very fast while charging.**

When this happens to you, this could mean 2 things. 1. your battery cells are gone or 2. you dont   
have a charger wich charges fast enough.The fix for this one is to buy a faster charger off amazon. I   
bought a 137 watt/h charger from   
amazon. It was around $40. It works very good.

**2. Surface keeps detaching.**

So this one is very easy. My detach button didnt work anymore so I used a different method. Stick a   
paperclip in the 6 th hole at the side of your screen. You should push at a 45^(o) angel. When you do   
this it will detach the screen. Next you want to get a microfobic cloth and some rubbing alcohol. Put   
the alcohol onto the cloth and clean the keyboard pins. After that, put the cloth around the round   
side of your paperclip and stick that into the left and right hole in the screen. You can find those at   
the bottom. Now turn the screen on and wait a few seconds. When you are logged in, put the screen   
back onto the keyboard. Now it will be fixed.

**3. Screen randomly goes black for a few seconds.**

Also this one is a very easy fix. Go to the Microsoft store and install the Intel Graphics app. In the   
app, go to system, power and then turn off the 'automatic screen' refresh button. This will fix it.

**4. Randomly kicking out the dGPU(gtx 1060)**

The SB 2 kicks the dGPU out when its in sleep mode. You have to restart it when you want it to be   
back. So there is a easy fix for this. Go to system, on/off and power, go to sleep mode and put that   
on like 1 hour when charging. 

&#x200B;

Now I will give you some extra tips for gaming:

\- Turn on hardware acceleration

\- Turn on best performance

\- Install GeForce drivers and GeForce Experience

\- Use a external screen (better FPS)

\- Go into settings, screen, graphics and chose for the games you want to play the gtx 1060.

&#x200B;

These were all the issues I could remember. If there are more, I will add them on the list. Please like my post, so more people see it.

Microsoft Law Firm Intake Automations (Windows*),"I work in a big law firm that insists on only needing Microsoft office suite(365) to track cases, store files, communicate, etc., and **I want to automate some of our processes** & don't want to pay for a service.  My understanding is that there are a few ways I could go about this, and I would really like some more information on **pros/cons of each method, especially in regards to our office being 100% iMac/Macbook operated**.

**Here are the methods I currently see as options:**

***1- Microsoft Power Automate / Power Apps.***

***2- C# Automations***

***3- Developer side of Microsoft Office 365 (?)***

MY VISION (for more insight) -  a potential client calls in, our consult person opens the Consultation microsoft form, fills in the needed info, then hits ""submit"". Then the info from the form gets formatted into an email & automatically sent to the boss (through outlook).

To take it a step further, if this is possible, I want the email that the boss receives to have an easy way of responding. Maybe suggested response options like ""reject"" , ""Schedule"" , ""Dispute lead"" , etc.. The goal is to no longer have to rely on our 63 y/o Founding Partner to hit the Reply ALL button, type either ""reject"" or ""send to all"", also remember to note whether to dispute or archive the lead, & be able to just choose from a couple options & either we all get notified or we can all view his responses somewhere.

**Microsoft Forms sends info to -> Outlook** formats info into email **& sends to pre-specified recipients ->** Create an easy way for recipients to **reply quickly & effectively.** \- outlook plugin maybe??

LAST THING I really want to figure out is an easy way for our consult guy to draft letters after receiving the response from our Founder. I am picturing a way he could use the info from the Microsoft Consultation form to draft/create a new Word Doc from a template using info on the form info to fill spaces. (ex: Founder replies ""Reject"" to a lead; Consult guy needs to create a Reject Letter to mail to the person & can use the Microsoft Consultation Form to somehow create & draft the reject letter with the person's information in only a couple clicks.)

**Google Forms -> Word Doc Template**  (& a couple extra steps lol)

How To Sync Samsung Gallery with OneDrive Education Account? Any Alternatives?," 

I have a S22 Ultra and wanted to backup my photos, videos, and other documents, etc.

From Microsoft's website, it says

""Your Samsung Gallery can only be connected to OneDrive personal accounts (i.e. not OneDrive for work or school users).""

The workaround I've tried is to use apps like OneSync (a random cloud and device syncing app on Play Store) to connect my OneDrive and mobile device folder. However, it says that upon signing in with my school account, I received the ""Need Admin Approval"" message. Do I need to tell my school admin to accept it (and would they even do that?? or would this approval cause some security compromise that admins won't take?)

For now my brother lost his discord and epic games account which i hope i can recover it.

Now I have changed his password(again), which still required me to enter MY full email to get 2fa code. How did the hackers do it? I also clicked on ""Sign me out"" to sign out from all of the devices, which doesn't seems to be working(my brothers outlook on his android is still signed in).

How can i prevent something like this in the future? 2fa doesn't seems to be working, so how?

Sorry, I forgot to write it but there were unsuccessful sign-in attempts until it WAS successful. So the hacker got access to the email and until 30 minutes later we were aware of it they got access to his discord account and epic games account and changed their password first and then ultimately their account email....

How to guide: M365 CoPilot - Prerequisites Announced - How to hit them!,"Hey R/Microsoft! Just thought I'd quickly post about Microsoft 365 CoPilot and it's pre-reqs being announced; the long and short of it is you will need:

E3 or E5 licenses (Business premium maybe, but not confirmed) assigned to users to use CoPilot
There may, or may not be an additional CoPilot license. Details to follow.
Your Office client will need to be on the Current or Enterprise Monthly channel
Your networking topology will need to align with MS best practices for performance purposes
As an FYI, CoPilot runs in your own Azure instance aligned to your Azure AD, doesn't reach out to OpenAI / ChatGPT. MS don't claim ownership of data or train future AI models based on your prompts

The main part of the requirements is the networking; local breakout is almost certainly going to be a must for performance here. CoPilot will always write to the users home region for data sovereignty purposes, so this is going to be important.

For anyone who's interested, I've just put a deep-dive up on YT going over the requirements with some how-to's and a couple of demo's: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn3mUOCwJJY

Is the Hybrid Exchange Environment a Thing of the Past?,"My organization has a hybrid Exchange environment. Running Exchange 2016 servers, and Exchange Online. 

However, every previous place I‚Äôve worked for has moved off of on-premise Exchange as quickly as possible in favor of Exchange online. My goal is to see to it we move off of Exchange on-premise too, using some different reason to ‚Äúsales pitch‚Äù why:

- it shifts the IaaS responsibility and subsequent man hours to Microsoft and away from us
- it no longer requires us to be on-prem on our corporate network just to make changes (no more VPNs or being in the office just to reach our servers)
- security patching is no longer on us and moves to Microsoft, and thus risk factor moves at least partly to Microsoft as the responsible party for maintaining back-end tenant security (short of us doing something stupid ourselves and allowing our tenant to be compromised)

But my main question is: is the hybrid Exchange model a dying breed? I‚Äôm not even aware of anyone who utilizes on-prem Exchange purely anymore (though there might be some out there).",1689346932.0

MS is better making games than OS,"windows is very unstable and slow comparing to linux, windows indeed was better in the 9x era (regarding new useful features and performance) but slowly began to get worse and worse.

but one thing that is still good are the games, MS rarely produces a bad game, from viva pi√±ata to age of empires they made a good job, until today games released by microsoft are great.

ms is not gaining as much money from the OS as gains with ither stuff, people rarely buy windows for personal use, some companies migrated to linux, almost all servers are linux and overall windows doesnt seem to profit as much as their other apps like Office and visual studio pro/enterprise.

honestly MS is slowly losing profit on OS scenario and if they want to keep moving forward they could migrate windows to linux kernel.

this is not the first time windows migrated kernel, we had in the past MSDOS kernel and was migrated to NT, but NT is already getting old, new systems are losing compatibility with old software and is becoming bloated.

MS could migrate to the linux kernel and make a more open software so they waste less on maintaining.

with this migration + opening source it will make MS the dominant OS again for being linux and will be cheaper to maintain as FOSS OS.. also problems will be fixed as soon as found by the community.

in exchange they should open NT to make migration of windows apps to linux easier.",1688670584.0

"Bluetooth keyboard covers, mouse lagging"," Hello. I wanted to discuss Bluetooth keyboards with touchpads.

I bought two Bluetooth keyboard covers: ESR Rebound, and also a very similar Officelab keyboard cover.

Their condition seems to be very good, they seem to be new or barely used. But there is an issue that seems to come from the software side.

I would like to use this bluetooth device not only with iPad, but also with my other tablet devices - Unfortunately connecting it to anything else (android tablet, phone and also a windows tablet) caused issue with touchpad. Movements from left to right (sides) are alright and smooth, but movements from top to down (vertical) are very jumpy.

Like I said I tried it with various devices and the same happens everywhere. I tested various settings on Windows as well, but this only improvement happened when lowering cursor sensitivity by a lot, what made it too sluggish to use.

All other functions work (even changing volume and other features), so it's really saddening. Is there a solution to this issue? Maybe drivers? I wanted to have something that works also for my Windows tablet (not just iPad). I wouldn't want to return either one of them, as I like everything else about them.

I really wanted something that can be used outside of only iPad - This is the main reason why I got a Bluetooth keyboard/touchpad and not the more costly one (which can be connected only to an IPad).

Notepad 10 -> 11,"I still use Windows 10 and don't want to upgrade yet. I also frequently use remote software like TeamViewer and RustDesk (I use the latter) to help my friends frequently.

How to get out of Win 10 Safe Mode with no Screen Display Monitor,"I'm sure someone will find this helpful... this is quite a niche and rare problem that i couldn't find any forum with a solution to. So i write this post in the hopes of helping someone out there.

Last night i managed to lock myself out from my Laptop that has a broken screen / display / monitor. First i managed to get a backup image feed through an HDMI-cable to my TV.

But before i realized the monitor was not only black but actually broken, i restarted the laptop in Safe Mode and voila now my TV didn't get a signal either. Nice /s.

With my phone i searched far and wide and found plenty of forums where lots of people had the exact same problem but no one was able to answer as if they had a brain, saying stuff like: ""Restart the computer, wait until you see this and that, then just click there and there bla bla bla"" completely ignoring the Main point that the person asking CANT Fkn SEE where to click! Super frustrated i started to map it out myself and finally managed to get out of it. If you are in the same position i suspect you would like to do the same so...

...follow these steps:

1: If you have a password, do whatever you can to presumably end up at the welcome screen / start screen. If the computer is shut down just start it up, let it ""finish"" and you should be there (and pray that you aren't in the blue screen of ""Windows Startup Settings"" mode cause i have no idea where these next steps will take you if you are).  
2: So let's presume you are at the welcome screen. Press the Left Pad/Mouse button ONCE to activate the password box. Some laptops want you to press ""SpaceBar"" and some wants you to press ""Enter"" to activate it. But one mouse click usually does it. Try to remember which one you usually do and do that.

3: Type your password and hit enter. Be ware!: If you have a Laptop with a Number-pad to the right it will be deactivated so if you have numbers in your password use the standard numbers above the letters... took me a while to figure this one out lemme tell ya.

4: Now you wait a minute to make sure the computer is fully done with it's startup.

5: Then... press and hold ""WINdows Key"", then press, ""R"" then let go of both.  
6: Type: ""msconfig"" and hit Enter.  
7: Wait 10 seconds to let this new thing open.

8: Now press: Up Arrow, Up Arrow, Enter, Tab, Enter. And pray that you did everything correct. If you did, the computer will restart and the second monitor (TV in my case) will come online and you may give this post an upvote.

If it didn't work: You presumably didn't get past the welcome screen. Press and hold the power button, let it power down fully, start it again and retry from step 2. Keep trying until it works. I had to do this for like an hour before i figured it out.

Good Luck!

P.S.  
I did this on Win 10. It might work with older and newer versions? I don't know? Lets hope it does.

Windows 11 Microsoft Teams Personal Download,"Hi all. I needed to download Microsoft Teams Personal on my Windows 11 System. As you know from the Microsoft Store, only the work version is available and when I tried via the Teams Download Website, both links were downloading the work version. 

I then found this link, [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2187217](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2187217) , which is even linked in the Microsoft Store. I installed it and logged in (however I must say that it was super laggy) and tbh I started worrying it was a virus or something so I deleted it from Add or Remove Programs in Settings. It must also be noted that if I hover over the Downloaded File in the Downloads its description is 'Installer for Squirrel-based applications' with version [1.4.4.0](https://1.4.4.0) and named MSTeamsSetup\_c\_l\_.

I think I need something that basically does the opposite as Fences in my life,"You ever played 52 pickup? Or organize the pile of crap on your desk? Sometimes it's just easier to start making stacks that are visually/physically located on different parts of my visual field/physical space. Fences is great for organizing a desktop screen from what I can tell, but unless I'm missing some of what the software does, it's not what I am looking for... what if I want all of my file systems within the windows explorer system to have the same properties as my desktop? i.e. I can drag icons and folders within a folder to different visual locations in the folder just as one would on a desktop screen.

It would be so easy for someone like me if I opened up a folder that I was in the process of sorting records, and in one corner of the folder I had icons and folders that were related to work, in another corner things related to school and in a different spot I had things related to games or whatever else.

I get I could essentially do all of that on my desktop. But I tend to take breaks from projects as some are longer than others, so trying to reassemble a desktop as it pertains to any given project is impractical on many levels. And I also understand that I could create folders in different sections of my desktop to sort of emulate this process, but that is also limited as it requires you to open multiple folders when you are backtracking work.
